# Welcome to JovarkOS!
***JovarkOS is an Arch-based GNU/Linux distribution offering stability, usability, and speed, in that order.***

## Who we are:
**Teens! Most members of the JovarkOS Development Team will be under the age of 18.**
That means that if you are a teen, you most likely are eligible to help out as well.
If you would like to participate in development, please answer the following questions in an email to [admin@jovarkos.org](mailto:admin@jovarkos.org):
 - Do you currently use Linux as a daily driver?
    - If so, what is the output of the `uname -a` command? 
 - What is your favorite distro? 
    - Why? Be specific, but being a distrohopper is OK too.
 - What development/team environment are you familiar with? Can you cite where you get your ideas and development philosophy?
    - We loosely adhere to the [Agile DevOps philosophy](https://agilemanifesto.org), and of course, the [Unix Philosophy](http://s3.eurecom.fr/~balzarot/softdev/material/0_2_unix_philosophy.pdf), without sacrificing stability, usability, and speed.
 - Roughly, without giving too much information, tell us where in the world you live. 'Cause we don't want to force people to have Zoom meetings at 3AM.
    - We already have members that live in opposite sides of the globe. Make sure you tell us if you live in Antartica.
 - Describe why you think that you would be a good fit for being on the JovarkOS Development team.
    - Yes, even if you are just a GIMP designer. We need those too :)

## What is JovarkOS?
**We're glad you asked.**
Simply put, we would say that:
`
JovarkOS is an Arch-based GNU/Linux distribution offering stability, usability, and speed, in that order.
`
*Sounds familiar, right?*


Thats right. We use Arch *(btw)*. Why did we choose this?
 - We are geeks, just like you. We love customizing our desktop, creating extensions for it, making it our own unique interface. 
 Cause we can do that with Linux.
 - Arch provides speed without lack of software. With access to the AUR (Arch User Repository), made up of user-contributed open-source software, it's one of the largest software repositories in existance.
 - It's what we use. Every day. To develop JovarkOS, and other personal projects.
 *(Actually, lots of our development has been on a Chromebook. Not kidding. Funny, right?)*

 ## Our Mission
 **If you haven't already gathered that we are young developers having fun, read ^^^**

 Our mission and goal is to create a stable, usable, and fast operating system based on the latest and greatest of GNU/Linux. Nothing ever will be outdated, and you get the best of software right from the source.

 Your system will be fast, tailored to students and teens. That means:
 - The most compatible office software will come preinstalled for you students that don't have MS Office, or don't like Google Docs.
 - Your system will have a selection of curated software titles designed, tested, and *recommended* for students around the globe. Cool, huh?
    - *Some of these applications can be installed by our customizable [convenience scripts](dir_install.md).*
 - Gamers will be right at home. JovarkOS is essentially made up of the same software found on the upcoming [Steam Deck from Valve](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck). We strive to bring you a start to the ultimate gaming experience without hassle. *#SteamProtonLife*
 - Provide a system easy enough for **beginners** to use, but also customizable for advanced **powerusers** to do their work.
 - We facilitate the use of your favorite social media clients such as Discord, Instagram, and QQ Chat. 
 - We will strive not to *elitist*, bash other distros, or hold other members of our community in contempt because of the software they *choose* to run. We like Arch, Linus Torvalds likes Fedora. Use what works for *you*. 
 - Finally, if there is something you would like to point out, our Discord server is a great way to do that! [Invite](https://discord.gg/8jabsmuyU3)
