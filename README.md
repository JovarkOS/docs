# Welcome to JovarkOS!
***JovarkOS is an Arch-based GNU/Linux distribution offering stability, usability, and speed, in that order.***

## Who we are:
**Teens! Most members of the JovarkOS Development Team likely will be under the age of 18.**
That means that if you are a teen, you most likely are eligible to help out as well.
If you would like to participate in development, please answer the following questions in an email to [admin@jovarkos.org](mailto:admin@jovarkos.org):
 - Do you currently use Linux as a daily driver?
    - If so, what is the output of the `uname -a` command? 
 - What is your favorite distro? 
    - Why? Be specific, but being a distrohopper is OK too.
 - What development/team environment are you familiar with? Can you cite where you get your ideas and development philosophy?
    - We loosely adhere to the [Agile DevOps philosophy](https://agilemanifesto.org), and of course, the [Unix Philosophy](http://s3.eurecom.fr/~balzarot/softdev/material/0_2_unix_philosophy.pdf), without sacrificing stability, usability, and speed.
 - Roughly, without giving too much information, tell us where in the world you live. 'Cause we don't want to force people to have Zoom meetings at 3AM.
    - We already have members that live in opposite sides of the globe. Make sure you tell us if you live in Antartica.
 - Describe why you think that you would be a good fit for being on the JovarkOS Development team.
    - Yes, even if you are just a GIMP designer. We need those too 

## What is JovarkOS?
**We're glad you asked.**
Simply put, we would say that:
`
JovarkOS is an Arch-based GNU/Linux distribution offering stability, usability, and speed, in that order.
`
*Sounds familiar, right?*


Thats right. We use Arch *(btw)*. Why did we choose this?
 - We are geeks, just like you. We love customizing our desktop, creating extensions for it, making it our own unique interface. 
 Cause we can do that with Linux.
 - Arch provides speed without lack of software. With access to the AUR (Arch User Repository), made up of user-contributed open-source software, it's one of the largest software repositories in existance.
 - It's what we use. Every day. To develop JovarkOS, and other personal projects.
 *(Actually, lots of our development has been on a Chromebook. Not kidding. Funny, right?)*

 ## Our Mission
 **If you haven't already gathered that we are young developers having fun, read ^^^**

 Our mission and goal is to create a stable, usable, and fast operating system based on the latest and greatest of GNU/Linux. Nothing ever will be outdated, and you get the best of software right from the source.

 Your system will be fast, tailored to those who want customization, but not at the cost of usability. That means:
 - Your system will have a selection of curated software titles designed, tested, and *recommended* for daily use.
    - *Find some of these applications with the `jovark-software-recommendations` tool (Still in development).*
 - Gamers will be right at home. JovarkOS is essentially made up of the same software found on the [Steam Deck from Valve](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck). We strive to give you a base for an enjoyable gaming experience without too much configuration. *Hint: Use Proton*
 - Provide a system easy enough for **beginners** to use, but also customizable for advanced **powerusers** to do their work.
 - We facilitate the use of your favorite social media clients such as Discord, Instagram, Signal, Telegram, and Element.
 - We will strive not to *elitist*, bash other distros, or hold other members of our community in contempt because of the software they *choose* to run. We like Arch, Linus Torvalds likes Fedora. Use what works for *you*. 
 - Finally, if there is something you would like to point out, our Discord server is a great way to do that! [Invite](https://discord.gg/8jabsmuyU3)
